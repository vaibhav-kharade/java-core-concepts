# Java Logic and Problem Solving Practice

This repository contains a curated collection of Java logic-building exercises, algorithms, and problem-solving implementations. It is designed to strengthen core Java concepts, backend logic, and software development skills essential for full-stack development and DevOps engineering roles.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Vaibhav Kharade** — a Java Full Stack Developer and DevOps Enthusiast.  
This repository showcases my dedication to mastering core programming concepts, backend system design, and efficient Java coding practices.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Maven
- Spring Boot (for advanced modules)
- Git & GitHub
- Docker (for containerization)
- MySQL / MongoDB (for persistence logic)
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA

## 📂 Repository Structure

The following structure will be implemented progressively to organize Java logic and full-stack components efficiently:

## 📈 Goals of This Repository

- Strengthen problem-solving with real-world Java challenges.
- Improve backend design using Spring Boot and REST APIs.
- Build deployable modules with Docker and DevOps principles.
- Prepare for technical interviews and system design rounds.
- Demonstrate clean code, test coverage, and version control practices.

## 🧪 Testing

JUnit and mock testing will be added inside the `/tests` directory with structured test cases to verify logic.
